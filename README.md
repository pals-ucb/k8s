## My Federated kubernetes Cluster 
This repository captures all the configurations and setup, that I have used to federate several of my kubernetes clusters. I have several k8s cluster
deployed in cloud, at home using all pieces of worker nodes. They run different types of CNI plugins.
Sometime, I add a new node to one of the cluster and this repository ansible section helps me to match the existing cluster with ease.
Just fun stuff.
